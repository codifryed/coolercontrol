# This is the CoolerControl configuration file.
# Comments and most formatting is preserved.
# Most of this file you can edit by hand, but it is recommended to stop the daemon when doing so.
# -------------------------------


# Unique ID Device List
# -------------------------------
# This is a simple UID and device name key-value pair, that is automatically generated at startup
#  to help humans distinguish which UID belongs to which device in this config file.
#  Only the device name is given here, complete Device information can be requested from the API.
#  UIDs are generated sha256 hashes based on specific criteria to help determine device uniqueness.
# ANY CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
# Example:
# 21091c4fb341ceab6236e8c9e905ccc263a4ac08134b036ed415925ba4c1645d = "Nvidia GPU"

# Legacy690 Option for devices
# -------------------------------
# There are 2 Asetek 690LC liquid coolers that have the same device ID.
#  To tell them apart we need user input to know which cooler we're actually dealing with.
#  This is an assignment of liquidctl AseTek690LC device UIDs to true/false:
#   true = Legacy690 Cooler aka NZXT Kraken X40, X60, X31, X41, X51 and X61
#   false = Modern690 Cooler aka EVGA CLC 120 (CLC12), 240, 280 and 360
# Example:
# 21091c4fb341ceab6236e8c9e905ccc263a4ac08134b036ed415925ba4c1645d = true

# Device Settings
# -------------------------------
# This is where CoolerControl will save device settings for the cooresponding device.
# Settings can be set here also specifically by hand. (restart required for applying)
# These settings are applied on startup and each is overwritten once a new setting
# has been applied.
# Example:
# [device-settings.4b9cd1bc5fb2921253e6b7dd5b1b011086ea529d915a86b3560c236084452807]

# logo = { lighting = { mode = "fixed", colors = [[0, 255, 255]] } }

# Cooler Control Settings
# -------------------------------
# This is where CoolerControl specifc general and specifc device settings are set. These device
# settings differ from the above Device Settings, in that they are applied to CoolerControl,
# and not on the devices themselves. For ex. settings such as disabling/enabling a particular device.
[settings]

# whether to apply the saved device settings on daemon startup

# Whether to enable the integration with liquidctl.
# Disabling this will prevent any communication with liquidctl,
# and all HWMon supported devices will be shown.
liquidctl_integration = true

# There are some devices that are supported both by liquidctl and hwmon drivers. Normally the
# preference is to use liquidctl as it supports more features such as RGB control. There are
# some cases where the hwmon driver is preferred though. Note: Care should be taken to blacklist
# one of the devices to avoid needlessly loading the device IO and avoid concurrency issues.
# Use at your own risk.

# For ThinkPads, wheather to use the 'full-speed' option when settings the fan to 100%
# This option drives the fan as fast as it can go, which might exceed hardware limits,

# API Address and Port:
# The daemon by default uses port 11987 and the standard loopback IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
# You can set an IPv4, IPv6 or both addresses to listen on. An empty string will disable the address.
# It is highly recommended to use the default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them
# and understand the implications.
# If you expose the API to a public network, it is recommended to use TLS/HTTPS (see below).
# For more information see the project wiki.
# Example:
# port = 11987
# ipv4_address = "127.0.0.1"
# ipv6_address = "::1"

# Whether to compress the response payload from the API. This will reduce the size of the response
# but will increase CPU usage a tiny bit. This is useful if you are running the API over a network.
# 'compress' is deprecated, use compress_payload instead.

# return 0C as their reporting temperature.
drivetemp_suspend = false

# TLS/HTTPS Configuration:
# TLS to secure the REST API with HTTPS. (enabled by default)
# When enabled, a self-signed certificate will be automatically generated on first startup if no
# certificate paths are specified. The certificate and key are stored in /etc/coolercontrol/ by
# default.
# Note: Self-signed certificates will cause browser warnings. You can provide your own
# certificate by specifying the paths below, or use a reverse proxy (nginx, caddy, traefik)
# to handle TLS termination as an alternative approach.
# tls_enabled = true

# Reverse Proxy / CORS Configuration:
# Custom origins to allow in CORS requests. This is useful when accessing CoolerControl through
# a reverse proxy with a custom domain, or via port forwarding with a public IP. Add the full
# origin URL (scheme + host + port if non-standard).
# origins = ["https://coolercontrol.mydomain.com", "http://192.168.1.1:8080"]

# Header to check for the client's original protocol when behind a reverse proxy. Common values
# are "X-Forwarded-Proto" (nginx, Apache) or "X-Scheme". When this header indicates "https",
# the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect is skipped (the proxy handles TLS termination).
# protocol_header = "X-Forwarded-Proto"

# Allow unencrypted HTTP connections from non-localhost addresses. By default, non-localhost
# HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS when TLS is enabled. Set this to true to allow HTTP.
# Note: This should only be used as a last resort and is not recommended.

# Whether to auto-detect Super-I/O hardware sensors and load the appropriate kernel
# modules at startup. This helps ensure all hwmon chips are available. (x86_64 only)
