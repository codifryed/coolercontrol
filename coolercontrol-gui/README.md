# coolercontrol-gui

is the frontend client for `coolercontrol`.

(some normal Coolero readme stuff)

Minimum OS required (due to Pyside6 requirements):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Fedora...
- GCC...

_Note: coolercontrol itself can run on oder systems, but the gui must then be run on another system and connect
remotely. Aka a headless configuration.
